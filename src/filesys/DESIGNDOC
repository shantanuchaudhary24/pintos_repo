		     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES
		     ============================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or

>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

A file can be as big as the disk has remaining space.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> extend a file at the same time.

>> A5: Explain how your synchronization design provides "fairness".

---- RATIONALE ----

We've used multilevel indexing. This facilitates adressing of files as large as the disk itself.

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct inode_disk
  {
    block_sector_t start;               /* First data sector. */
    off_t length;                       /* File size in bytes. */
    unsigned magic;                     /* Magic number. */
    bool isDir;
    uint32_t unused[124];               /* Not used. */
  };

isDir keeps track of whether the inode is of type dir.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

To traverse a path we use inode_by_path function, which starts from 'cwd' or root depending upon
whether the adress starts with '/' or not.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.

>> B5: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it
>> is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current
>> working directory?  If so, what happens to that process's future
>> file system operations?  If not, how do you prevent it?

Yes, we can remove the current working directory. In future, if we try to create a new file in this directory or open '.' or '..' it will fail.

			     BUFFER CACHE
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

#define CACHE_SIZE 	 64
defines the max size of beffer cache array

#define BUFFER_VALID 0x1
#define BUFFER_DIRTY 0x2
Valid and Dirty bits to mark the buffer

#define MARK_EMPTY -1
To ininitialise the integer to -1

#define WRITE_BACK_INTERVAL TIMER_FREQ*20
Interval after which periodic flushing takes place

typedef struct buf
{
	int flag;
	int accessed;
	block_sector_t sector;
	void *data;
}struct_buf;

Defines the structure of an entry in the array.
The entry contains a flag to tell the status of the entry
The accessed field tells the number of accesses to the entry
The sector field stores the corresponding sector to which
cache entry is stored.The data field stores the data read
from the disk or to be written to the disk.

struct_buf bcache[CACHE_SIZE];
Array which is used to represent the buffer cache

struct lock bcache_lock;
Lock for atomic insertion and deletion of cache entries.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.
The cache eviction takes place through a clock algorithm plus clever
use of number of accesses to the cache entry.The clock hand moves in
a circular fashion to check if the accessed field of an entry is 0 or 
less than 0.If it is greater than zero it decrements the accessed field
and moves to the next entry and continues in this fashion. If it doesn't
find any entry to evict and reaches the point where it started from then
it evicts that entry i.e. writes it to disk an returns the empty cache entry
in the buffer cache array.

>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.
Write behind has been implemented by spawning a thread after the buffer
cache is initialised.This thread calls a function that consists of calls
which sleeps the thread for 20 seconds and then it calls flush_cache
which writes the entries marked dirty to the disk. 

>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.
We spawn a thread which checks a list of sectors to be inserted into the cache
If it finds the list non-empty, it reads the sectors into the cache else it sleeps
The corresponding wakeup is done when the sectors are added to the list of read_ahead_sectors

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a
>> buffer cache block, how are other processes prevented from evicting
>> that block?

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.
